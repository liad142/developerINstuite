    There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries..

<h3>The Lions</h3>
<hr>
Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and savannahs, but is absent in dense forests.
<br>
It is usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at night and at
<br>
twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males, related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and
<br>
composition from three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey availability. Females cooperate when
<br>
hunting and prey mostly on large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and even giraffe
<br>
